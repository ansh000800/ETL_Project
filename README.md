# ETL_Project
Python+SQL
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using real-world data.

Extraction: I used the Kaggle API to extract a dataset in CSV format.

Transformation: Leveraging Python, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation using libraries like Pandas.

Loading: The cleaned and transformed data was then loaded into MySQL Workbench for structured storage and querying.

Analysis: Using SQL, I conducted basic data analysis to uncover insights and trends from the dataset.

This end-to-end workflow gave me practical experience in handling real data pipelines, integrating tools across the data stack, and performing analysis using both Python and SQL.
